There are hundreds of tools available for legal professionals in digital evidence. Some of these tools are forensically sound, while others arn't, which makes those in that category not the best options for digital forensics examiners. The first thing to know as a digital forensics examiner is that the whole process of digital forensics is divided in foru major steps: _Acquisition_, _Preservation_, _Analisys_ and _Presentation_.

## Acquisition
Acquisition is the process of collecting and creating a forensically sound copy of the electronic evidence collected. This is the first step on the digital forensics process since this is when the digital forensics expert first comes in contact with the evidence itself. This step is crucial because if the data is acquired incorrectly (_e.g._ if the data is not copied with a forensically sound tool) then it's autentacity will be questioned. To perform a proper acquisition the forensic copies must be done with a forensically sound tool. Some of the tools that can be used are:
* Forensic Toolkit (FTK)
* EnCase
* Logicube
* Tableau
* Wibetech

Bear in mind that when we are working with acquisition on digital evidence we may use software tools or hardware tools. The hardware tools used are usually write blockers. Write blockers prevent that when the expert is making a copy of the device with the evidence wrirtes on it by accident. _Tableau_ and _Wibetech_ are hardware tools that provide a write block function.
