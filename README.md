There are hundreds of tools available for legal professionals in digital evidence. Some of these tools are forensically sound, while others arn't, which makes those in that category not the best options for digital forensics examiners. The first thing to know as a digital forensics examiner is that the whole process of digital forensics is divided in foru major steps: _Acquisition_, _Preservation_, _Analisys_ and _Presentation_.

## Acquisition
Acquisition is the process of collecting and creating a forensically sound copy of the electronic evidence collected. This is the first step on the digital forensics process since this is when the digital forensics expert first comes in contact with the evidence itself. This step is crucial because if the data is acquired incorrectly (_e.g._ if the data is not copied with a forensically sound tool) then it's autentacity will be questioned. To perform a proper acquisition the forensic copies must be done with a forensically sound tool. Some of the tools that can be used are:
* Forensic Toolkit (FTK) (<https://accessdata.com/products-services/forensic-toolkit-ftk>)
* EnCase (<https://www.guidancesoftware.com/encase-forensic>)
* Logicube (<https://www.logicube.com/?v=0fe75a5189c2>)
* Wibetech (<https://www.cru-inc.com/cru-wiebetech/>)

Bear in mind that when we are working with acquisition on digital evidence we may use software tools or hardware tools. The hardware tools used are usually write blockers. Write blockers prevent that when the expert is making a copy of the device with the evidence wrirtes on it by accident. _Logicube_ and _Wibetech_ are hardware tools that provide a write block function. _FTK_, and _EnCase_ are tools that have multiple uses. Tools like these will be mentiones later on, since thet not only serve as acquisition tools, but they also have functions like verification, search, reporting, etc.

## Preservation
Preservation is the process of creating a chain of custody for every piece of digital evidence. The chain of custody is a document stating when, who, and how data was handled since before the evidence is collected until the evidence is returned to the owner or destroyed.If the chain of custody is broken, the validity of the evidence can be questioned. The chain of custody should also include detailed notes on how the evidence was handled. Although the chain of custody could be kept on a piece of paper there are tools that help organize the events in a better way.
* Microsoft Office (<https://products.office.com/es-mx/home>)
* Google Documents (<https://www.google.com/docs/about/>)
* Apple Pages (<https://www.apple.com/lae/pages/>)
* Normal Nootebooks
* TCMax (<https://www.ekprotrack.com/evidence-chain-of-custody-inventory-software.html>)

Some of these software tools are highly recognized and highly used for document creation in a daily base, while other may not be so common. _TCMax_ is an example of a not so common tool that provides full chain of custody features and also provides inventory and evidence tracking. It is important to have backups of the chain of custody in case of the destruction of the original.

## Analysis
Analysis is the process of finding the evidentiary items from the digital evidence acquired. The analysis of every case will be different and will involve the usage of different tools.
